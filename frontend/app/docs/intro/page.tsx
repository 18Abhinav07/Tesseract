                A credit protocol with memory. Built on Polkadot Asset Hub - live on testnet today.
            </p>

            <h2 id="problem">The Problem</h2>
            <p>
                DeFi lending has not solved credit. It has avoided it. Every protocol built in the last five years
                operates on the same assumption: trust no one, require overcollateralisation, charge everyone the
                same rate.
            </p>
            <p>
                This works well enough to process volume. It does not work for participants who have built
                genuine on-chain track records - borrowers who have repaid consistently across months or years,
                who participate in governance, who carry a verifiable financial history. They get priced
                identically to a wallet opened this morning.
            </p>
            <p>
                The data to fix this has always existed. Every repayment, every liquidation, every governance
                vote is timestamped and immutable on-chain. The obstacle is turning that record into a
                defensible, manipulation-resistant credit score that materially changes borrowing terms - all
                inside smart contracts, with no off-chain trust assumption.
            </p>
            <p>That is what Kredio is.</p>

            <h2 id="what-it-does">What Kredio Does</h2>
            <p>
                Kredio assigns every borrower a credit score from 0 to 100, computed live at borrow time from
                four fully on-chain inputs: repayment history, deposit volume, liquidation record, and account
                age. The score maps directly to a collateral ratio and interest rate - locked into each
                position at open, with no external oracle and no manual review.
            </p>
            <p>
                A first-time borrower at <strong>ANON</strong> tier posts 200% collateral and pays 15% APR.
                The same borrower after twelve repayments reaches <strong>DIAMOND</strong> tier - 110%
                collateral, 4% APR. The improvement is earned entirely through behaviour. No application. No
                identity verification required. No human in the loop.

            <h2 id="layers">Three Execution Layers</h2>
            <p>
                Kredio is a hybrid protocol combining three execution environments, each handling what
                it is architecturally best suited for.
            </p>
